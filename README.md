# programming-bitcoin-rust
This repository contains solutions to the exercises in the [Programming Bitcoin](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Bitcoin-Learn-Program-Scratch/dp/1492031496) book, by Jimmy Song. The book shows how to build a Bitcoin library from scratch, starting with fundamental cryptographic primitives, and then implementing Bitcoin-specific functionality like transactions, script and blocks. The exercises in the book are written in Python, so the code has been ported to Rust with the equivalent functionality.
